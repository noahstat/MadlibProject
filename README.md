# MadlibProject
Simple madlib project

Has a file cointaining all of the madlib options with the feilds to be replaces as keywords
The main madlib randomly selects one of the madlibs from the list 
To make adding more madlibs easier and faster a list with all the feilds and indexes is made
To add a new feild just add it to the list and the rest will be taken care of
The list is used to find all indexes of the occurrences of that feild where the indexes are stored in a 2d list
Using the list of feilds and indexes the user is promped for input one feild at a time and the input replaces the placeholder feild
Then the result is printed out, enjoy
